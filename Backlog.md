# Backlog

This is the queue for future features. Not. It is my memory list for things
that come up, and I wish to offload my brain by putting them here.

## Bugs

No known bugs.

## Usability

### Recognize arrow keys

While buttons are necessary for touch screen users, majority will use a 
keyboard and expect the arrow keys to work.

### Be lean on interpreting game code

Trim of spaces and accept thtat users sometimes forget the space in the middle as
it is perceived as a 6-digit number.

## Publish the BDD report

While putting the specification in a Word document has some value, 
I think the report of the test run also have that. Would it be possible
to publish that in a Travis build so that it can be linked to from the 
readme, like quality and build results?

## Testing with multiple players

Design choice to not use the URL to pick a game led to the impossibility
to have several sessions in the same browser, albeit two with anonymous
works. This is a bit inconvenient when testing. A solution could be to 
change the design but another would be to add **bot players**. That could be
valuable to users when the group is not large enough.

## Executing 

Nothing right now.

## Reporting

### Report outcome

Nothing right now.

## Facilitation

### Explain the visuals in the player list

They are small, and they are cryptic.

### Show the next phase 

Show the next phase to the facilitator so that they do not skip one 
by mistake.

## Release notes

After actually doing a release, although they decided not to use it,
it struck me that doing release notes in some interesting way is
certainly on the table.

## Build pipe

Why not set up a build pipe? Like Travis?
